@article{Copas2019,
	abstract = { Outcome reporting bias occurs when outcomes in research studies are selectively reported, the selection being influenced by the study results. For benefit outcomes, we have shown how risk assessments using the Outcome Reporting Bias in Trials risk classification scale can be used to calculate bias-adjusted treatment effect estimates. This paper presents a new and simpler version of the benefits method, and shows how it can be extended to cover the partial reporting and non-reporting of harm outcomes. Our motivating example is a Cochrane systematic review of 12 studies of Topiramate add-on therapy for drug-resistant partial epilepsy. Bias adjustments for partially reported or unreported outcomes suggest that the review has overestimated the benefits and underestimated the harms of the test treatment. },

@article{mvCopas,
	abstract = {
mv meta analysis, explain in more detail the contribution of variance of missing outcomes, missing at random.

 This is only valid under the assumption of data missing at random, that the chance of an outcome being unreported can be modelled as an independent chance mechanism conditional on the outcome estimates which actually are observed. Acknowledging this assumption can be crucially important in meta-analysis, where outcome reporting bias, e.g. when several outcomes are measured but only those showing a statistically significant effect are reported, is a common problem (Kirkham et al., 2010), although the simulations in Kirkham et al. (2012) suggest that in some circumstances multivariate methods can be more robust than univariate methods to departures from this assumption. Subjective assessments of the risk of outcome reporting bias (Kirkham et al., 2010) can lead to useful univariate bias corrections (Copas et al., 2013), and an extension to multivariate models may also be possible},
