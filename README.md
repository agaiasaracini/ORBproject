# ORBproject
This repository is a refinement of the "ORBmeta" and "Simulations" work done in the Master Thesis. The focus of the repository is on ORB adjustment (and associated simulations according to the protocol) via a selection model framework in the random effects model meta-analysis setting without the use of the ORBIT pre-classification system.
